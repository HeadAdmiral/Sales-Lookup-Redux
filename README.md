# Sales-Lookup-Redux
This is a Chrome extension which modifies the Sales Lookup page. 

Sales Lookup counts customers by incrementing a variable each time a transaction goes out on line 1 -- register 1. This means that any transactions that *don't* go out on register 1 are not counted as customers served. Obviously this leads to wildly inaccurate counts. The goal of the extension is to correct this inaccuracy and to add a few extras to the page as well.
